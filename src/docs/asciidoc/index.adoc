Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs .

`SampleJUnit5ApplicationTests 类` makes a call to a very simple service and produces three
documentation snippets 生成的adoc有很多个，但是现在只用了三个.

One showing how to make a request using cURL:

include::{snippets}/home/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

include::{snippets}/home/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/home/http-response.adoc[]
